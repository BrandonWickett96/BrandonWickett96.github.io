            <img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E03AQEQZUJzeMwa4g/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1571924141745?e=1750291200&v=beta&t=QqvBPd8bVf3GR32vvxv1ivtwodoLptR1PqtYtYDy8fU" alt="Professional Photo" align="left" width="300px" style="padding-right: 15px;">
            <p align="left">I graduated from Wentworth Institute of Technology with my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. After graduating, I entered the workforce starting with a  6 month contract working as a VDC Coordinator before moving on to working for Whiting Turner Contracting as a VDC Engineer where I have been for the past 6 years and have worked my way up to VDC Manager. </p>
            <p align="left">My programming journey started in college with taking various programming courses alongside my engineering workload where I dabbled in several languages (Java, Python, Matlab to name a few) and found I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, my current role doesn’t utilize these skills and they atrophied, but in 2025, I started working on a certificate in coding through MIT xPro to learn web development skills. My goal with this is to take these web development skills and find a way to incorporate them into my role as a VDC Manager.</p>
